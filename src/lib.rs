//! Clone any [`Stream`] `S` where `<S as Stream>::Item: Clone`.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use fork_stream::StreamExt as _;
//! use futures::stream::StreamExt as _;
//!
//! async fn example() {
//!     let source = futures::stream::iter(0..3);
//!
//!     let fork1 = source.fork();
//!
//!     let fork2 = fork1.clone();
//!
//!     assert_eq!(fork1.collect::<Vec<_>>().await, [0, 1, 2]);
//!     assert_eq!(fork2.collect::<Vec<_>>().await, [0, 1, 2]);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Behavior
//!
//! 1. Polled items from the source stream are stored in a buffer;
//! 2. When forks of the source stream are polled, they either yield clones of the items from the buffer,
//! or poll the source stream for new items;
//! 4. If there are no longer any forks that may read an item (either because the fork is dropped, or because
//! all of the forks have already yielded that item) the item is dropped;
//! 5. Whenever possible, items from the buffer are moved out instead of clonned.
//! 6. When all of the forks are dropped, source stream is dropped.
//!
//! ### `Weak`
//!
//! Any fork can be downgraded to a [`Weak`], which can later be upgraded back, similar to [`std::rc::Rc`] or [`std::sync::Arc`] APIs.
//!
//! This behaves as follows:
//!
//! 1. [`Weak`] does not implement [`Stream`] and cannot be polled without being upgraded first;
//! 2. When a [`Weak`] is upgraded into a [`Forked`], the resulting [`Forked`] is as advanced as the source stream;
//! i.e. it will not yield any items that had been yielded by any other forks prior to the upgrade.
//! 3. If all of the forks had been dropped prior to the upgrade, `Weak::upgrade` returns `None`.
//!
//! `Weak` API is useful when you want to reuse streams that are expensive to intialize,
//! but also want to drop them when they are not needed.
//!
//! ### Differences from `shared_stream`
//!
//! This library implements an API similar to that of [`shared_stream`](https://docs.rs/shared_stream), with a few notable differences:
//!
//! 1. Streams produced by this library are [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. For this reason we have to use synchronisation primitives that
//! support it, which may be less performant, but makes it a more suitable option for async environments.
//! 2. `shared_stream` buffers the items for as long as at least one clone of the source stream exists. This library "garbage collects"
//! the items as soon as possible. This comes at a cost of some extra business logic, which may be less performant, but makes it a more
//! suitable option for situations where streams are supposed to be long-lived, such as servers.
//! 3. This library provides a [`Weak`] API, see above.
